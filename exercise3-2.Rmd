## Setting up on GitHub!

Before starting your assignment, you need to get yourself set up on GitHub and make sure GitHub is connected to R Studio. To do that, you should read the instruction (through the "Cloning a repo" section) and watch the video [here](https://github.com/llendway/github_for_collaboration/blob/master/github_for_collaboration.md). Then, do the following (if you get stuck on a step, don't worry, I will help! You can always get started on the homework and we can figure out the GitHub piece later):

* Create a repository on GitHub, giving it a nice name so you know it is for the 3rd weekly exercise assignment (follow the instructions in the document/video).  
* Copy the repo name so you can clone it to your computer. In R Studio, go to file --> New project --> Version control --> Git and follow the instructions from the document/video.  
* Download the code from this document and save it in the repository folder/project on your computer.  
* In R Studio, you should then see the .Rmd file in the upper right corner in the Git tab (along with the .Rproj file and probably .gitignore).  
* Check all the boxes of the files in the Git tab and choose commit.  
* In the commit window, write a commit message, something like "Initial upload" would be appropriate, and commit the files.  
* Either click the green up arrow in the commit window or close the commit window and click the green up arrow in the Git tab to push your changes to GitHub.  
* Refresh your GitHub page (online) and make sure the new documents have been pushed out.  
* Back in R Studio, knit the .Rmd file. When you do that, you should have two (as long as you didn't make any changes to the .Rmd file, in which case you might have three) files show up in the Git tab - an .html file and an .md file. The .md file is something we haven't seen before and is here because I included `keep_md: TRUE` in the YAML heading. The .md file is a markdown (NOT R Markdown) file that is an interim step to creating the html file. They are displayed fairly nicely in GitHub, so we want to keep it and look at it there. Click the boxes next to these two files, commit changes (remember to include a commit message), and push them (green up arrow).  
* As you work through your homework, save and commit often, push changes occasionally (maybe after you feel finished with an exercise?), and go check to see what the .md file looks like on GitHub.  
* If you have issues, let me know! This is new to many of you and may not be intuitive at first. But, I promise, you'll get the hang of it! 



## Instructions

* Put your name at the top of the document. 

* **For ALL graphs, you should include appropriate labels.** 

* Feel free to change the default theme, which I currently have set to `theme_minimal()`. 

* Use good coding practice. Read the short sections on good code with [pipes](https://style.tidyverse.org/pipes.html) and [ggplot2](https://style.tidyverse.org/ggplot2.html). **This is part of your grade!**

* When you are finished with ALL the exercises, uncomment the options at the top so your document looks nicer. Don't do it before then, or else you might miss some important warnings and messages.


## Warm-up exercises with garden data

These exercises will reiterate what you learned in the "Expanding the data wrangling toolkit" tutorial. If you haven't gone through the tutorial yet, you should do that first.

  1. Summarize the `garden_harvest` data to find the total harvest weight in pounds for each vegetable and day of week (HINT: use the `wday()` function from `lubridate`). Display the results so that the vegetables are rows but the days of the week are columns.

```{r}
garden_harvest %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(date, label = TRUE),
         lbs = weight*0.00220462) %>% 
  group_by(vegetable, weekday) %>% 
  summarize(veg_day_total = sum(lbs)) %>%
  arrange(weekday) %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols = vegetable,
              names_from = weekday, 
              values_from = veg_day_total)
```

  2. Summarize the `garden_harvest` data to find the total harvest in pound for each vegetable variety and then try adding the plot from the `garden_planting` table. This will not turn out perfectly. What is the problem? How might you fix it?

```{r}
garden_harvest %>% 
  group_by(vegetable, variety) %>% 
  mutate(lbs = weight*0.00220462) %>%
  summarize(total_harvest = sum(lbs)) %>% 
  left_join(garden_planting,
            by = "vegetable")
```

There is a mismatch is the number of entries in garden harvest and garden planting set. This is because some varietes had multiple harvests for a single planting. As a result there could be more than one entry in garden harvest for every entry in garden planting. To make the number of entries equal, you could use the pivot wider function on the garden harvest data set.


  3. I would like to understand how much money I "saved" by gardening, for each vegetable type. Describe how I could use the `garden_harvest` and `garden_spending` datasets, along with data from somewhere like [this](https://products.wholefoodsmarket.com/search?sort=relevance&store=10542) to answer this question. You can answer this in words, referencing various join functions. You don't need R code but could provide some if it's helpful.

  Left join the garden harvest data, garden spending data, and whole foods data by vegetable and variety. From there, I would use the mutate function to create a price from whole foods variable, by multiplying the total harvest (in pounds) by the price per pound. I would create another variable, price from garden, that would be the price of each seed multiplied by the number of each seeds used. I would sum each column and subtract the second from the first.

  4. Subset the data to tomatoes. Reorder the tomato varieties from smallest to largest first harvest date. Create a barplot of total harvest in pounds for each variety, in the new order.CHALLENGE: add the date near the end of the bar. (This is probably not a super useful graph because it's difficult to read. This is more an exercise in using some of the functions you just learned.)

```{r}
garden_harvest %>% 
  filter( vegetable == "tomatoes") %>% 
  group_by(variety) %>% 
  mutate(harvest_lbs = weight*0.00220462) %>% 
  summarise(first_harvest = min(date),
            total_harvest_lbs = sum(harvest_lbs)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = total_harvest_lbs, y = fct_reorder(variety, first_harvest))) +
  geom_col(fill = "blue") + 
  labs(title = "Tomato Variety Harvests, smallest to largest first harvest date", x = "Tomato Harvest Weight (lbs)", y = "Tomato Variety")
```

  5. In the `garden_harvest` data, create two new variables: one that makes the varieties lowercase and another that finds the length of the variety name. Arrange the data by vegetable and length of variety name (smallest to largest), with one row for each vegetable variety. HINT: use `str_to_lower()`, `str_length()`, and `distinct()`.
  
```{r}
garden_harvest %>% 
  mutate(lowercase = str_to_lower(variety),
         namelength = str_length(variety)) %>% 
  arrange(vegetable, namelength) %>% 
  distinct(variety, .keep_all = TRUE)
```

  6. In the `garden_harvest` data, find all distinct vegetable varieties that have "er" or "ar" in their name. HINT: `str_detect()` with an "or" statement (use the | for "or") and `distinct()`.

```{r}
garden_harvest %>% 
  distinct(variety, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(has_string = str_detect(variety, "er|ar")) %>% 
  filter(has_string == TRUE)
```


## Bicycle-Use Patterns

In this activity, you'll examine some factors that may influence the use of bicycles in a bike-renting program.  The data come from Washington, DC and cover the last quarter of 2014.

<center>

![A typical Capital Bikeshare station. This one is at Florida and California, next to Pleasant Pops.](https://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/bike_station.jpg){width="30%"}


![One of the vans used to redistribute bicycles to different stations.](https://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/bike_van.jpg){width="30%"}

</center>

Two data tables are available:

- `Trips` contains records of individual rentals
- `Stations` gives the locations of the bike rental stations

Here is the code to read in the data. We do this a little differently than usual, which is why it is included here rather than at the top of this file. To avoid repeatedly re-reading the files, start the data import chunk with `{r cache = TRUE}` rather than the usual `{r}`.

```{r cache=TRUE}
data_site <- 
  "https://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/2014-Q4-Trips-History-Data-Small.rds" 
Trips <- readRDS(gzcon(url(data_site)))
Stations<-read_csv("http://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/DC-Stations.csv")
```

**NOTE:** The `Trips` data table is a random subset of 10,000 trips from the full quarterly data. Start with this small data table to develop your analysis commands. **When you have this working well, you should access the full data set of more than 600,000 events by removing `-Small` from the name of the `data_site`.**

### Temporal patterns

It's natural to expect that bikes are rented more at some times of day, some days of the week, some months of the year than others. The variable `sdate` gives the time (including the date) that the rental started. Make the following plots and interpret them:

  7. A density plot, which is a smoothed out histogram, of the events versus `sdate`. Use `geom_density()`.
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = sdate)) +
  geom_density() + 
  labs(title = " Density Plot of Bike Rentals by Date", x = "Month", y = "Denisty of Bike Rentals")
```
  
  8. A density plot of the events versus time of day.  You can use `mutate()` with `lubridate`'s  `hour()` and `minute()` functions to extract the hour of the day and minute within the hour from `sdate`. Hint: A minute is 1/60 of an hour, so create a variable where 3:30 is 3.5 and 3:45 is 3.75.
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(rent_hr = hour(sdate),
         rent_min = minute(sdate),
         rent_time = rent_hr + (rent_min/60)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = rent_time)) + 
  geom_density() +
  labs(title = "Density Plot of Duration that Bikes Were Rented", x = "Duration of Bike Rental (minutes)", y = "Density")
```

9. A bar graph of the events versus day of the week. Put day on the y-axis.
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  group_by(sdate) %>% 
  mutate(day_of_week = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = day_of_week)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "blue") + 
  labs(title = "Number of Bike Rentals on Different Days of the Week", y = "Day of Week", x = "Count of Bike Rentals")
```
  
  
  
  10. Facet your graph from exercise 9. by day of the week. Is there a pattern?
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(rent_hr = hour(sdate),
         rent_min = minute(sdate),
         rent_time = rent_hr + (rent_min/60)) %>% 
  group_by(sdate) %>% 
  mutate(day_of_week = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = rent_time)) + 
  geom_density() +
  facet_wrap(vars(day_of_week)) + 
  labs(title = "Bike Rental Duration for Each Day of the Week", x = "Duration of Bike Rental (minutes) ", y = "Proportion of Riders")
```
For days during the week, the highest proportion of bike renters keep a bike for a little less then twenty minutes, while the second highest proprotion of renters keep a bike for about 7 or 8 minutes. On the weeknds, the highest proporiton of bike renters keep a bike for a little less then fifteen minutes.
  
The variable `client` describes whether the renter is a regular user (level `Registered`) or has not joined the bike-rental organization (`Causal`). The next set of exercises investigate whether these two different categories of users show different rental behavior and how `client` interacts with the patterns you found in the previous exercises. 

  11. Change the graph from exercise 10 to set the `fill` aesthetic for `geom_density()` to the `client` variable. You should also set `alpha = .5` for transparency and `color=NA` to suppress the outline of the density function.
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(rent_hr = hour(sdate),
         rent_min = minute(sdate),
         rent_time = rent_hr + (rent_min/60)) %>% 
  group_by(sdate) %>% 
  mutate(day_of_week = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = rent_time)) +
  geom_density(aes(fill = client, alpha = 0.5, color = "NA")) +
  facet_wrap(vars(day_of_week)) +
  labs(title = "Density Plot of Bike Rentals for Clients and Non-Clients, by time and day of the Week", x = "Time of Bike Rental", y = "Proportion of Bike Rentals")
  
```

  12. Change the previous graph by adding the argument `position = position_stack()` to `geom_density()`. In your opinion, is this better or worse in terms of telling a story? What are the advantages/disadvantages of each?
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(rent_hr = hour(sdate),
         rent_min = minute(sdate),
         rent_time = rent_hr + (rent_min/60)) %>% 
  group_by(sdate) %>% 
  mutate(day_of_week = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = rent_time)) +
  geom_density(aes(fill = client, alpha = 0.5, color = "NA"), position = position_stack()) +
  facet_wrap(vars(day_of_week)) + 
  labs(title = "Density Plot of Bike Rentals for Clients and Non-Clients, by time and day of the Week", x = "Time of Bike Rental", y = "Proportion of Bike Rentals")
```
Figure 1 overlapses the casual and registered trendlines while Figure 2 puts the registered trendline in the foreground and the causal trendline in the background. Also, figure 1 systematically underestimates the proportion of casual riders. Figure one and figure two can both be used, depending on what story wants to be told, however figure two is a more accurate model; Figure one would most likely be used when proporiton of the causal and registered riders did not matter, but the periods of min and max ridership for each group matter for a decision.
 
  
  13. In this graph, go back to using the regular density plot (without `position = position_stack()`). Add a new variable to the dataset called `weekend` which will be "weekend" if the day is Saturday or Sunday and  "weekday" otherwise (HINT: use the `ifelse()` function and the `wday()` function from `lubridate`). Then, update the graph from the previous problem by faceting on the new `weekend` variable. 
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(week_day = wday(sdate, label = TRUE),
         hour = hour(sdate),
         minute = minute(sdate),
         time = hour + minute/60,
         weekend = ifelse(week_day %in% c("Sat", "Sun"),"weekend","weekday")) %>% 
   ggplot(aes(x = time, fill = client, alpha = .5)) +
    geom_density() +
    facet_wrap(vars(weekend)) +
    labs(title = "Bike Rental Frequency by Time of Day", 
         x = "Time", 
         y = "Frequency")
```
  
  14. Change the graph from the previous problem to facet on `client` and fill with `weekday`. What information does this graph tell you that the previous didn't? Is one graph better than the other?
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(week_day = wday(sdate, label = TRUE),
         hour = hour(sdate),
         minute = minute(sdate),
         time = hour + minute/60,
         weekend = ifelse(week_day %in% c("Sat", "Sun"),"weekend","weekday")) %>% 
   ggplot(aes(x = time, fill = weekend, alpha = .5)) +
    geom_density() +
    facet_wrap(vars(client)) +
    labs(title = "Bike Rentals by Time of Day", 
         x = "Time", 
         y = "Frequency")
```
The second graph flips weekday and weeknd from the head of each smaller graph to the colors. Graph two makes it more evident that Casual riders have simillar riding habits (with regard to how long they rent for) on weekends and weekdays whereas Registered riders typically do not. The second graph also shows us that there is more casual riders on the weeknd then registered riders and there may be more registered riders renting on the weekday then casual riders (who have to do an integration to confirm).
 
  
### Spatial patterns

  15. Use the latitude and longitude variables in `Stations` to make a visualization of the total number of departures from each station in the `Trips` data. Use either color or size to show the variation in number of departures. We will improve this plot next week when we learn about maps!
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(name = sstation) %>%
  left_join(Stations, by = c("name")) %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  mutate(departures = n()) %>% 
   ggplot(aes(y = lat, x = long, color = departures)) +
   geom_point() +
   labs(title = "Location of Stations With Number of Departures",
        y = "Latitude",
        x = "Longitude")
```
  
  
  16. Only 14.4% of the trips in our data are carried out by casual users. Create a plot that shows which area(s) have stations with a much higher percentage of departures by casual users. What patterns do you notice? (Again, we'll improve this next week when we learn about maps).
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(name = sstation) %>%
  left_join(Stations, by = c("name")) %>% 
  mutate(cas = client == "Casual") %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  mutate(departures = n(),
         cas_pct = sum(cas)/departures) %>% 
   ggplot(aes(y = lat, x = long, color = cas_pct)) +
   geom_point() +
   labs(title = "Location of Stations with Percentage of Casual Riders",
        y = "Latitude",
        x = "Longitude")
```
The highest percentage(or tied for highest) of Casual riders was around the same location where the highest number of departures took place (circa latitude 38.9, longitude -77.05). There was also the second highest percentage (or tied for highest) of Casual riders clustered in the top left corner of our graph.
**DID YOU REMEMBER TO GO BACK AND CHANGE THIS SET OF EXERCISES TO THE LARGER DATASET? IF NOT, DO THAT NOW.**

## Dogs!

In this section, we'll use the data from 2022-02-01 Tidy Tuesday. If you didn't use that data or need a little refresher on it, see the [website](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2022/2022-02-01/readme.md).

  17. The final product of this exercise will be a graph that has breed on the y-axis and the sum of the numeric ratings in the `breed_traits` dataset on the x-axis, with a dot for each rating. First, create a new dataset called `breed_traits_total` that has two variables -- `Breed` and `total_rating`. The `total_rating` variable is the sum of the numeric ratings in the `breed_traits` dataset (we'll use this dataset again in the next problem). Then, create the graph just described. Omit Breeds with a `total_rating` of 0 and order the Breeds from highest to lowest ranked. You may want to adjust the `fig.height` and `fig.width` arguments inside the code chunk options (eg. `{r, fig.height=8, fig.width=4}`) so you can see things more clearly - check this after you knit the file to assure it looks like what you expected.

```{r, fig.height= 30, fig.width = 15}
breed_trait_total <- breed_traits %>%
  select(- c("Coat Type", "Coat Length")) %>% 
  mutate(total_rating = rowSums(.[2:15])) %>% 
  select(Breed, total_rating) %>% 
  filter(total_rating != 0)

breed_trait_total %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = fct_reorder(Breed, total_rating), x = total_rating)) +
  geom_point(color = "aquamarine3") + 
  labs(title = "Dog Traits Total Ranking by Breed", x = "Total Ranking of Breed Traits", y = "Dog Breed")
```

  18. The final product of this exercise will be a graph with the top-20 dogs in total ratings (from previous problem) on the y-axis, year on the x-axis, and points colored by each breed's ranking for that year (from the `breed_rank_all` dataset). The points within each breed will be connected by a line, and the breeds should be arranged from the highest median rank to lowest median rank ("highest" is actually the smallest number, eg. 1 = best). After you're finished, think of AT LEAST one thing you could you do to make this graph better. HINTS: 1. Start with the `breed_rank_all` dataset and pivot it so year is a variable. 2. Use the `separate()` function to get year alone, and there's an extra argument in that function that can make it numeric. 3. For both datasets used, you'll need to `str_squish()` Breed before joining. 


```{r}
breed_top20 <- breed_trait_total %>%
  mutate(Breed = str_squish(Breed)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_rating)) %>%
  mutate(numberrow = 1:n()) %>%
  filter(numberrow <= 20)

breed_final <- breed_rank_all %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("20"),
               names_to = "year",
               values_to = "value") %>%
  separate(year,
           into = c("year"),
           convert = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(Breed = str_squish(Breed)) %>%
  right_join(breed_top20,
           by = "Breed") %>%
  arrange(desc(total_rating))

median_breed <- breed_final %>%
  group_by(Breed) %>%
  summarize(median_rank = median(value)) %>%
  arrange(median_rank)

left_join(breed_final, median_breed) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = reorder(Breed, desc(median_rank)))) +
  geom_point(aes(color = value)) +
  scale_color_gradientn(colours = rainbow(15))

```
 
 
  
  19. Create your own! Requirements: use a `join` or `pivot` function (or both, if you'd like), a `str_XXX()` function, and a `fct_XXX()` function to create a graph using any of the dog datasets. One suggestion is to try to improve the graph you created for the Tidy Tuesday assignment. If you want an extra challenge, find a way to use the dog images in the `breed_rank_all` file - check out the `ggimage` library and [this resource](https://wilkelab.org/ggtext/) for putting images as labels.
  
```{r}
breed_top10 <- breed_trait_total %>%
  mutate(Breed = str_squish(Breed)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_rating)) %>%
  mutate(numberrow = 1:n()) %>%
  filter(numberrow <= 10)

breed_final <- breed_rank_all %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("20"),
               names_to = "year",
               values_to = "value") %>%
  separate(year,
           into = c("year"),
           convert = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(Breed = str_squish(Breed)) %>%
  right_join(breed_top10,
           by = "Breed") %>%
  arrange(desc(total_rating))

mean_breed <- breed_final %>%
  group_by(Breed) %>%
  summarize(mean_rank = mean(value)) %>%
  arrange(mean_rank)

left_join(breed_final, mean_breed) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = reorder(Breed, desc(mean_rank)))) +
  geom_point(aes(size = value))
```

## Challenge problem! 

This problem uses the data from the Tidy Tuesday competition this week, `kids`. If you need to refresh your memory on the data, read about it [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-09-15/readme.md). 

  21. In this exercise, you are going to try to replicate the graph below, created by Georgios Karamanis. I'm sure you can find the exact code on GitHub somewhere, but **DON'T DO THAT!** You will only be graded for putting an effort into this problem. So, give it a try and see how far you can get without doing too much googling. HINT: use `facet_geo()`. The graphic won't load below since it came from a location on my computer. So, you'll have to reference the original html on the moodle page to see it.
  


**DID YOU REMEMBER TO UNCOMMENT THE OPTIONS AT THE TOP?**
